# springboot-oauth2-demo
Small project to demonstrate OAuth2 login

## Private Keys and secrets in this project

Although normally **no private information should be published**, the private keys and secrets used in this project are checked in deliberately for demonstration purposes. Neither of these secrets is used anywhere else, they are created solely for this demo and even then can be treated as ephemeral.

If you use this code for anything else than demonstration purposes, make sure to **use your own keys and secrets and keep them private**, e.g. don't put the secrets in the default *application.yml*
